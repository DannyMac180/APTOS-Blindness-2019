## Kaggle APTOS Blindness 2019 Competition

This is a submission for the Kaggle data science competition: [APTOS Blindness 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection)

The code can be found in the Jupyter notebook in this repo. This was my first Kaggle competition after spending 6 months studying Fast.ai's video courses.

I'm proud to say that I finished 153rd out of 2943 in the competition, landing in the Top 6% and earning a bronze medal.
